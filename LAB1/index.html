            I was born in Michigan, USA and lived there for about five years due to my father's job. At six year's old, our family including
            me moved to Korea. When I was 15 years old (2nd year at middle school), our family moved to Egypt again due to my father's job. It was 
            really hard for me to adapt in Egypt because not only Egypt's culture is completely different from Korea in regard to religion, 
            culture, food, and school but I also was not good at English. While studying at the international school, I really worked hard to improve
            my English skills so, as a result, I could graduated my high school with the highest GPA among the students at the same grade. Before
            I came to Yonsei University which I am currently studying at, I studied at University of California, San Diego (UCSD) for three months, 
            majoring at Computer Science.

            Being in Yonsei University changed my life a lot. I am currently belong to many clubs: Euphonia, PoolC, and Molgorithm.
            Firstly, <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/@user-yz9ep3ku9g/featured">Euphonia</a> is the Yonsei Amateur Orchestra Club. I am playing clarinet in this club, and we practiced eight hours every Tuesday, 
            Thursday, and Saturday during summer/winter break. We are opening the concert at the first day of each semester. We played
            Die Fledermaus Overture, The Firebird, and Stravinsky Symphony No. 1 during the summer break, and Academic Festival Overture, Tchaikovsky 
            Piano Concerto No. 1, and Sibelius Symphony No. 1. Secondly, in PoolC club, there are lots of professionals in this club, so 
            this motivated me to study and push myself a lot. While being in this club, I have studied Unity programming as well as ML/DL. 
            At last, in Molgorithm club, I have solved lots of programming problems and studied algorithms used for PS. I have participated in 
            <a href = "https://www.acmicpc.net/contest/view/950">SUAPC</a> and got 2nd place, and am currently preparing for ICPC that will be held next semester. <br>
            The experience in these clubs changed my personality a lot in a positive and extroverted way and helped me to make lots of friends
            in Korea.
