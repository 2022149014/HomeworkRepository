            I was born in Michigan, USA and lived there for about five years due to my father's job. At six year's old, our family including
            me moved to Korea. When I was 15 years old (2nd year at middle school), our family moved to Egypt again due to my father's job. It was 
            really hard for me to adapt in Egypt because not only Egypt's culture is completely different from Korea in regard to religion, 
            culture, food, and school but I also was not good at English. While studying at the international school, I really worked hard to improve
            my English skills so, as a result, I could graduated my high school with the highest GPA among the students at the same grade. Before
            I came to Yonsei University which I am currently studying at, I studied at University of California, San Diego (UCSD) for three months, 
            majoring at Computer Science.

            we played ""
